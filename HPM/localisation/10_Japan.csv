plantations_in_japan_desc;The rapid industrialization and modernization of Japan following the Meiji Restoration both allowed and required a massive increase in production and infrastructure. Japan built industries such as shipyards, steelmaking furnaces, and tea plantations, which were then sold to well-connected entrepreneurs.
