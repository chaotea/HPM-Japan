plantations_in_japan_desc;The rapid industrialization and modernization of Japan following the Meiji Restoration both allowed and required a massive increase in production and infrastructure. Japan built industries such as shipyards, steelmaking furnaces, and tea plantations, which were then sold to well-connected entrepreneurs. Consequently, domestic companies became consumers of Western technology and applied it to produce items that would be sold cheaply in the international market. With this, industrial zones and agricultural farms grew enormously, greatly boosting Japan's economic might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
